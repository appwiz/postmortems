Backwards time flow from tracking [the 27th leap second on 2016-12-31T23:59:60Z](https://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.52) caused the weighted round-robin selection of DNS resolvers (RRDNS) to panic and fail on some CNAME lookups.  Go's `time.Now()` was incorrectly assumed to be monotonic; this injected negative values into calls to `rand.Int63n()`, which panics in that case.
