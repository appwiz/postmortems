One night in July 2012, a skewed electricity supply-demand profile developed when the northern grid drew a tremendous amount of power from the western and eastern grids. Following a series of circuit breakers tripping by virtue of under-frequency protection, the entire NEW (northern-eastern-western) grid collapsed due to the absence of islanding mechanisms. While the grid was reactivated after over 8 hours, similar conditions in the following day caused the grid to fail again. However, the restoration effort concluded almost 24 hours after the occurrence of the latter incident.
