The Google Meet Livestream feature experienced disruptions that caused intermittent degraded quality of experience for a small subset of viewers, starting 25 October 2021 0400 PT and ending 26 October 2021 1000 PT. Quality was degraded for a total duration of 4 hours (3 hours on 25 October and 1 hour on 26 October). During this time, no more than 15% of livestream viewers experienced higher rebuffer rates and latency in livestream video playback. We sincerely apologize for the disruption that may have affected your business-critical events. We have identified the cause of the issue and have taken steps to improve our service.
