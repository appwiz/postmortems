NASA's Mars Pathfinder spacecraft experienced system resets a few days after landing on Mars (1997).  Debugging features were remotely enabled until the cause was found: a [priority inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion) problem in the VxWorks operating system.  The OS software was remotely patched (all the way to Mars) to fix the problem by adding priority inheritance to the task scheduler.
