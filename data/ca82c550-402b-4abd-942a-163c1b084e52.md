Prior to the incident flight the reservation system from which the load sheet was produced had been upgraded. A fault in the system caused female passengers checked in with title ‘Miss’ to be counted as children. The system allocated them a child’s standard weight of 35 kg as opposed to the correct female standard weight of 69 kg. Consequently, with 38 females checked in incorrectly and misidentified as children, the G-TAWG takeoff mass from the load sheet was 1,244 kg below the actual mass of the aircraft.
