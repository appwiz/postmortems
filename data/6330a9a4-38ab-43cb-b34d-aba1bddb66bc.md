Google Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity for lower priority traffic such as batch, streaming and transfer operations from 19:30 US/Pacific on Thursday, 14 July 2022, through 15:02 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July 2022. High-priority user-facing traffic was not affected. This service disruption resulted from an issue encountered during a combination of repair work and a routine network software upgrade rollout. Due to the nature of the disruption and resilience capabilities of Google Cloud products, the impacted regions and individual impact windows varied substantially.
