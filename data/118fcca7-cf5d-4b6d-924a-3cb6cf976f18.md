Flowdock instant messaging was unavailable for approx 24 hrs between April 21-22 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a sudden and drastic increase in working from home, which caused a higher usage of Flowdock, which caused high CPU usage, which caused the application database to hang. Some user data was permanently lost.
