The WebKit repository, a Subversion repository configured to use deduplication, became unavailable after two files with the same SHA-1 hash were checked in as test data, with the intention of implementing a safety check for collisions. The two files had different md5 sums and so a checkout would fail a consistency check. For context, the first public SHA-1 hash collision had very recently been announced, with an example of two colliding files.
